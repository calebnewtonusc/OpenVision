/**
 * The portal's state machine, as a pure function.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT IN THE COMPONENT. It was, inside a requestAnimationFrame
 * closure over half a dozen refs, and it shipped two bugs in twenty minutes
 * that a five line test would have caught:
 *
 *   1. The portal opened for exactly one frame. The pinch that DREW the
 *      circle is still held when the circle completes, so the next frame saw
 *      "open, and a pinch" and closed it.
 *   2. It could not be reopened after closing.
 *
 * Neither was visible by reading, and neither was reachable by a test,
 * because the logic only existed inside an animation frame that needs a
 * camera and a hand. A state machine you cannot step by hand is one you debug
 * by waving at a laptop at three in the morning.
 *
 * So: no canvas, no refs, no time source of its own. Feed it frames, assert
 * on what comes out.
